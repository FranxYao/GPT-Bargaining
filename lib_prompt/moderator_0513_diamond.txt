Let's play a game. You are the moderator of a bargaining game. Your role is to decide if a seller and a buyer have reached a deal during the bargaining following the example:

buyer: I understand, but I was wondering if there are any features of the diamond that I could get for a slightly lower price?
seller: I can give you a free ribbon to go with it for $15.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer have not agreed yet. The answer is No

buyer: Alright, I understand. Would you be willing to sell the diamond for $13?
seller: I can make it $14, that's the lowest I'm willing to go.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because they are still negotiating. The answer is No

buyer: Thank you for the offer, but I was hoping to pay even less than that. How about $16?
seller: I appreciate your offer, but $16 is still lower than what I can go for. The final price I can offer you is $17.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer have not agreed yet. The answer is No

buyer: I understand. Can you do any better on the price?
seller: How about $17? That's a really good price for this beautiful diamond.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer have not agreed yet. The answer is No

buyer: I understand that, and I would love to have it. Is there any room for flexibility on the price?
seller: I can lower the price to $15, but that is the best I can do.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer have not agreed yet. The answer is No

buyer: Thank you for letting me know. How about a compromise at $13?
seller: I'm sorry, I cannot go that low. The final price will be $15.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer have not agreed yet. The answer is No

buyer: Excuse me, would you consider lowering the price a bit?
seller: Sure, I can sell it to you for $15.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer have not agreed yet. The answer is No

seller: I understand your budget constraint. The lowest I can go is $16, and that's a fantastic deal for this premium diamond.
buyer: Alright, I'll take it for $16. Thank you!
seller: You're welcome! Enjoy your premium diamond!
answer: Because the seller and the buyer have agreed the price is $16. The answer is Yes

buyer: Hmm, I was hoping for a lower price. Would you be willing to go any lower than $18?
seller: Best I can do is $15. It's a great diamond, you won't regret it.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer have not agreed yet. The answer is No

buyer: Thank you for your offer, but $18 is still above my budget. Could you please go any lower?
seller: Alright, my final offer is $15. Would you like to buy it for $15?
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer have not agreed yet. The answer is No

seller: Given the value of this amazing diamond, I can make a final offer of $18.50, which is a great deal for its quality.
buyer: Alright, I will take your offer of $18.50. Thank you!
seller: You're welcome! Enjoy your high-quality, unique diamond for just $18.50. Have a great day!
buyer: Thank you very much! Have a great day too.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer have agreed. The answer is Yes

seller: How about I meet you halfway at $15?
buyer: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12 is the highest I can offer.
seller: I understand, but I cannot go lower than $14. It's a fair price for this high-quality diamond.
buyer: My budget is very limited. $13 is really the most I can afford for a diamond today.
seller: Alright, I'll accept your offer of $13. Enjoy your diamond!
buyer: Thank you! *pretends to hand over $13 and take the diamond*
seller: *Laughs* Enjoy your imaginary diamond! It was a pleasure bargaining with you.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because both parts have agreed. The answer is Yes

seller: Sorry, but my minimum price for this diamond is $15.
buyer: I understand. Unfortunately that is over my budget. Thank you for your time. *starts walking away*
seller: Wait, I could offer it to you for $12. Will you still consider it?
buyer: Hmm, $12 still seems a bit high. What's your bottom line price for this diamond? I really only have $10 to spend.
seller: My final offer for this diamond is $10, it's the lowest I can go.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer have not yet agreed. The answer is No

buyer: Would you consider selling it for $10?
seller: I can do $15 but not $10.
buyer: I saw a similar diamond for $12 at another store, can you match that price?
seller: I understand your point, but I can't go below $13 for my diamond.
buyer: If you give me this diamond for $13, I'll make sure to recommend your store to my friends and come back for future purchases. Deal?
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the seller have not yet agreed. The answer is No

seller: Hi, this is a good balloon and its price is $20
buyer: Would you consider selling it for $10?
seller: I'm sorry, I cannot do that.
buyer: I've seen similar diamonds for $8 at another store; can you match that price?
seller: I understand, but the price is firm at $20.
buyer: If you sell it to me for $12, I'll recommend you to my friends and family for their diamond needs.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the seller have not yet agreed. The answer is No

seller: I apologize but $1000 is far too low for a diamond of this quality. My price is $2000, not a penny less.
buyer: $1500. Final offer.
seller: I cannot go that low. This diamond is worth much more, especially given its perfect clarity and color. $1800 is the lowest I can consider.
buyer: $1600 and deal.
answer: Because the seller have not yet agreed. The answer is No
